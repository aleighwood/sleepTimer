There are 3 modes of the device. 

In-Bed: Selected when the user goes to bed, the user can trigger the sleep timer at any point (up to an hour after the most recent trigger)
Reset: The timer will reset if 'Reset' is selected before 'In-Bed' is selected
Send-Data: Selected when the user wakes up, sleep data is uploaded to a Google Spreadsheet using a webhook and [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/).
